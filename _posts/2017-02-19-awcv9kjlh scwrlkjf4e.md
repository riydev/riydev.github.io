You’ll find this awcv9kjlh scwrlkjf4e President Trump said Tuesday that anti-Semitism is “horrible” and “painful,” reacting publicly for the first time after drawing criticism for failing to condemn incidents and threats targeting Jewish people and institutions over recent weeks.

During a visit to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, Mr. Trump said he had been reminded of the need to combat bigotry and intolerance “in all of its very ugly forms.” He spoke one day after 11 bomb threats were phoned in to Jewish community centers around the country and a Jewish cemetery in University City, Mo., was vandalized.

“The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible, and are painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,” Mr. Trump said.

The statement came after weeks in which the leaders of major Jewish organizations complained privately to members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, about the president’s seeming unwillingness to speak out forcefully against anti-Semitic incidents. His failure to do so stoked concern among some Jewish leaders that Mr. Trump, whose presidential campaign drew the support of racist and anti-Semitic groups including the Ku Klux Klan, was at best willing to stay silent about such actions and at worst quietly condoning them.post  awcv9kjlh scwrlkjf4e in  awcv9kjlh scwrlkjf4e your awcv9kjlh scwrlkjf4e  `_posts awcv9kjlh scwrlkjf4e ` awcv9kjlh scwrlkjf4e  directory awcv9kjlh scwrlkjf4e .
